Energy Analytics Dashboard: A Step-by-Step Guide for Energy Analysts
================================================================

Welcome to the Energy Analytics Dashboard. As a developer, I designed this tool to help you uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers in global energy data. Here is how you can use the dashboard effectively:

Step 1: Get Oriented & Select Your Metric
-----------------------------------------
When you first open the dashboard, you'll see a high-level view of the world.
- Use the "Select Indicator" dropdown at the top to choose the primary metric you want to investigate (e.g., CO2 emissions, electricity access, or petroleum usage).
- Use "Filter by Region" to focus your analysis on a specific continent like "Europe" or "Asia".
- The KPI cards immediately update to show global/regional statistics for your chosen indicator.

Step 2: Geographic Analysis (The Map Tab)
------------------------------------------
The "Map" tab provides a choropleth view.
- Darker or brighter colors (depending on the scale) represent the intensity of your selected indicator.
- Hover over any country to see its exact value.
- Click on a country to highlight it across all other charts in the dashboard. This "Bidirectional Highlighting" is key to multi-view analysis.

Step 3: Bivariate & Trend Analysis (Analytics Tab)
--------------------------------------------------
Switch to the "Analytics" tab for deeper dives:
- Scatter Analysis: Select two different indicators (X and Y axes) to see how they correlate. For example, compare "Real GDP per Capita" vs. "Electricity Access". 
- Click on any point to see which country it represents.
- Top-N Ranking: The bar chart shows you the leaders (or laggards) for your selected indicator. You can adjust the "Top N" number to see more or fewer countries.

Step 4: Understanding Relationships (Correlation & Heatmaps)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Correlation Heatmap: Select multiple parameters to see a matrix of how they relate. A score near 1.0 indicates a strong positive relationship, while -1.0 indicates a strong inverse relationship.
- This helps you identify which economic or geographic factors most influence energy consumption.

Step 5: Multivariate Profiling (Parallel Coordinates)
----------------------------------------------------
- Parallel Coordinates: This is a powerful tool for finding "country profiles". Each vertical axis is a different metric.
- Click and drag along any axis (called "Brushing") to filter for countries that meet specific criteria (e.g., "Show me countries with high GDP BUT low CO2 emissions").
- The "Linked Table" below will automatically list the exact countries that fall within your brushed range.

Step 6: Clustering & Dimensionality (PCA / Clusters Tab)
-------------------------------------------------------
- The PCA (Principal Component Analysis) tab uses machine learning to group similar countries together based on all selected parameters.
- It identifies "natural" clusters of countries that share similar energy profiles, even if they are in different geographic regions.

Pro-Tip: Bidirectional Highlighting
-----------------------------------
Remember, clicking a country in the Map, Scatter Plot, or Rank Chart will "lock" that country's highlight across every other visualization. This allows you to track a single country's performance across its geography, its ranking, and its multivariate profile simultaneously.

If you have any questions about the data cleaning or the specific machine learning models used in the PCA, please reach out!
